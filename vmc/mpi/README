Now we derive the MPI version from the sequential version using incremental transformation

0) compile with mpicxx ... it should just work as before

1) Include <mpi.h> (first!) and initialze and finalize MPI but with all
   processes still doing all of the work

2) Compute number of points per processor taking care of corner cases
   and ensuring good work distribution.

3) Carefuly change a few Npoint to be NPPP and insert global summs

4) Restrict printing to process 0

5) Don't forget to set the random number stream


# These measured all on the same box with no attention to who
# else was running.
